        <h3>Backend</h3>
        <p>
          I built a REST API for this project using Node.js, Express, and
          Mongoose for the data model, and then deployed it on Heroku.
        </p>
        <p>
          CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are used to manage data
          in the non-relational database, which I created and hosted on MongoDB
          Atlas.

        <h3>Frontend: Planning</h3>
        <p>
          After testing the REST API endpoints and ensuring each functioned
          properly, I began planning the key features of the app.
        </p>
        <p>I started by determining the app views:</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Login and Sign-up View:</strong> Allows users to create
          accounts and authenticate themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main View:</strong> Displays all movies to the user, each with
          an image, title, and description. Clicking on a movie item accesses
          the Single Movie view, which shows detailed information about the
          movie and renders a list of movies with similar genres.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Profile View:</strong> Enables users to view and manage their
          profile data, update and delete their account, and save favorite
          movies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through a navigation bar, users can effortlessly navigate between
          views.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-steps">
        <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          I started by building the app components for the UI, such as
          MovieCard, FavoriteMovies, ProfileView, and UpdateUser.
        </p>
        <p>
          I integrated the API using Axios to fetch movie data from the
          database.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used state routing for navigation between different pages/views and
          managed state within the components using React hooks, useState, and
          useEffect.
        </p>
        <p>
          After main views were created, I started to implement some key
          features, such as the option to filter movies by genre, movie title,
          or director's name. Another key feature was giving users the ability
          to add movies to a favorites list, which is rendered on the profile
          page.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-steps">
        <i class="fas fa-pen-to-square"></i>
        <h3>Final Touches</h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of creating the app was to get acquainted with React
          and to build a full MERN stack application. While the focus was less
          on design, using the React Bootstrap library and CSS for styling and
          responsiveness allowed me to complete the layout of all pages and
          components within the limited timeframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          To debug the application I constantly used the browser developer tools
          and console statements.

        <h2>Responsive design</h2>
        <p>
          In developing Cine-verse, I prioritized user experience and
          functionality. Choosing React and React-Bootstrap allowed for the
          creation of interactive and responsive interfaces, ensuring a seamless
          experience across devices.
        </p>
        <h2>Areas for Future Improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, there are several enhancements that could be made to
          enrich the user experience:
        </p>

        <p>
          • Adding features like information about movie directors, sharing
          movies and creating a "To Watch" list would further engage users and
          improve accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>• Implementing dark mode functionality.</p>
        <p>
          • Additionally, refining styling elements, such as replacing the
          favorite button with an intuitive icon, would enhance the app's visual
          appeal and usability.

        <h3>Things that I enjoyed</h3>
        <p>
          Overall, developing the Cine-verse app was a great experience. It was
          fulfilling to see a project grow from zero to a fully functional and
          responsive application. I discovered the power of React and how easy
          it is to apply a design library like Bootstrap.
        </p>

        <h3>Things that Gave a Headache</h3>
        <p>
          One important lesson I learned while developing the frontend is that
          knowing the structure of the database is crucial. Any mistakes in
          building the endpoints can lead to significant issues. Many times
          while debugging the app, I ended up making changes to the API code.
